# Estimating Interchannel Interference in Nyquist-WDM Systems with GMMs and Deep Learning
This research project investigates a novel approach to estimating Interchannel Interference (ICI) in Nyquist-Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical systems. The methodology leverages Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to effectively model the distribution of constellation points, providing valuable insights into ICI characteristics. Key features extracted from the GMMs, such as mean and covariance matrices, are then employed to train a deep neural network (DNN) for spectral spacing regression or classification.
